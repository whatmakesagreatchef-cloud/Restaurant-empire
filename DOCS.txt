🎯 GAME OVERVIEW
==========================================

You're building a restaurant empire from scratch. Start with one venue, make it profitable, then expand. Balance:

💰 MONEY - Pay bills, invest in improvements, save for growth
👥 STAFF - Hire, train, and keep your team happy
🍽️ MENU - Design dishes that customers love and that make money
⭐ REPUTATION - Good reviews = more customers = more profit

==========================================
📚 CORE SYSTEMS EXPLAINED
==========================================

1. WEEKLY OPERATIONS
   - Each week, your restaurants serve customers
   - You earn revenue, pay costs, and see net profit
   - Review weekly reports to spot problems early
   - Take action on urgent issues in the Ops screen

2. MENU MANAGEMENT
   - Design your menu with items that balance profit & popularity
   - Stars: Your money-makers (high profit, high sales)
   - Plowhorses: Popular but lower margin (volume plays)
   - Puzzles: High margin but slow sellers (needs marketing)
   - Dogs: Low profit AND unpopular (remove or fix these!)
   
3. STAFF & MORALE
   - Burnout (0-100): Work stress. Keep below 60.
   - Morale (0-100): Overall happiness. Aim for 70+.
   - Hire managers (GM, Chef, FOH) to delegate and improve operations
   - Train staff to permanently boost skills (worth the investment!)

4. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
   - Food Quality (38%): Most important factor
   - Service Speed (18%): Fast service = happy customers
   - Value (16%): Fair prices for what they get
   - Vibe (16%): Atmosphere and ambiance
   - Cleanliness (12%): Basic hygiene matters
   
   Target: 70+ satisfaction. Below 60 = complaints & bad reviews.

5. SUPPLY CHAIN
   - Track inventory to avoid stockouts
   - Lock in supplier contracts when prices are good
   - Higher par levels = less stockouts but more waste
   - Do stocktakes to reduce spoilage temporarily

6. FACILITIES & MAINTENANCE
   - Equipment breaks down if not maintained
   - Breakdowns hurt speed, quality, and can cause closures
   - Spend on maintenance to prevent expensive repairs
   - Renovate when condition drops below 50

7. FINANCIALS
   - Food Cost: Target 25-32% of sales
   - Labor Cost: Target 28-38% of sales
   - Net Profit Margin: Aim for 8-15%
   - Keep 3+ months of cash as safety buffer

8. GROWTH & EXPANSION
   - Save profits or take loans to fund new venues
   - Each new venue adds complexity
   - Choose: Chain (one brand) or Portfolio (multiple brands)
   - Economies of scale kick in with 3+ locations

==========================================
💡 PRO TIPS
==========================================

🎯 STARTING OUT:
   - Don't expand too fast. Master one venue first.
   - Watch cash flow, not just profit
   - Hire a GM and Chef as soon as you can afford it
   - Train staff early - skills compound over time

💰 MAKING MONEY:
   - Menu pricing is your biggest lever
   - Small price increases (+5-10%) have big impact
   - Focus on high-volume items (Plowhorses & Stars)
   - Cut or fix Dogs - they drain money and kitchen time

👥 MANAGING STAFF:
   - Burnout prevention is cheaper than fixing high burnout
   - Use wellbeing days when burnout hits 60+
   - Staff issues get worse if ignored - address them
   - Delegation reduces your workload and improves metrics

📈 GROWING SMART:
   - Expand when you have 6+ months cash reserves
   - Second location is hardest - after that it gets easier
   - HQ central purchasing saves money with multiple venues
   - Brand standards boost consistency but increase pressure

⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES:
   - Overpaying staff (check market wages in Setup)
   - Underpricing menu items (low prices ≠ more customers)
   - Ignoring burnout until it's critical
   - Expanding without cash buffer (recipe for disaster)
